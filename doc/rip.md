# Obituary

These poor ICs have given their lives for this project.

May their contribution be long remembered.

## TCD1706, #1

This unit has died during a wiring mishap on a breadboard, where some connections were wired incorrectly.

Its Ã¸1 pins no longer present any appreciable amount of capacitive load.

It died prematurely before ever showing off its capabilities. 

Rest in peace. I am deeply sorry for this easily preventable loss.

## TCD1706, #2

This unit has died during a protective foil peeling mishap, when the poor thing was lifted off the breadboard, and pins
got touched.

Its clock pins still present normal loads, but I am not so sure about the SH, RS and CP pins.
Need to verify further.

It no longer presents any video outputs.

But it allowed me to see that my timing generation was actually correct, and that it was indeed possible to extract some
video from a slice of silicon.

Rest in peace. May things go a little less bad during the next peel-off.
